Code and data files used to generate Figures 2  and 4. The breseq workflow is also presented. Breseq (version 0.33.2) was used to assess mutations in clonal isolates from *F. johnsoniae* coevolved lines and *F. johnsoniae* monoculture lines. *F. johnsoniae* ancestor strain was also sequenced and analyzed by breseq to remove ancestor mutations from evolved lines.
