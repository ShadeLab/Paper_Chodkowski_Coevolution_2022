Sanger sequences that confirmed recombinant E. coli harboring the tolC 33 bp deletion and the tolC nonsynonymous mutation. These E. coli strains were then used in a triparental conjugation to transfer sequences of interest to the F. johnsoniae ancestor strain. Sanger sequences confirmed recombinant F. johnsoniae ancestor harboring the tolC 33 bp deletion and the tolC nonsynonymous mutation.
